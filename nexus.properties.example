# Nexus Launcher Configuration
# ================================

# IGDB API Credentials (Optional - for enhanced non-Steam game metadata)
#
# To get IGDB credentials:
# 1. Go to https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps
# 2. Log in with your Twitch account (create one if needed)
# 3. Click "Register Your Application"
# 4. Fill in:
#    - Name: Nexus Launcher (or any name)
#    - OAuth Redirect URLs: http://localhost
#    - Category: Application Integration
# 5. Click "Create"
# 6. Copy the Client ID below
# 7. Click "New Secret" and copy the Client Secret below
#
# igdb.client.id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE
# igdb.client.secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE

# Note: Without IGDB credentials, the app will:
# - Use Steam API for all Steam games (works perfectly, no key needed)
# - Search Steam for non-Steam games (often finds matches)
# - Fall back to hardcoded metadata for popular games
# - Show "No description available" for unrecognized games
